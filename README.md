## About
- Backend written using `Node.js/TypeScript w/ Express` utilizing the `sqlite3` package from the npm repository.
- Frontend written using `React` with default template from `create-react-app` and react-bootstrap for ease of styling.

## Getting Started
- Run `yarn` in the root directory (a.k.a db-proj5 directory)
- To run the client and the server simultaneously, run `yarn start`
    - If you wish to run the client or server separately:
        > `yarn client` or <br/> `yarn server`
- To reset the database to its default state, simply reboot the __server__ (reboot of client unnecessary).
